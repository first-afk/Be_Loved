## Styling Guide

This project uses CSS variables to keep the design consistent, themeable, and easy to maintain.

---

### Colors

Colors are named by purpose, not by shade.

- `--color-primary-pink` → Buttons and active states (brand color)
- `--color-bg` → Page and card backgrounds
- `--color-text-primary` → Main headings
- `--color-text-secondary` → Supporting text

---

### Spacing & Shape

A spacing scale ensures consistent gaps across the layout.

- Spacing variables (e.g., `--spacing-sm`, `--spacing-lg`) control padding and margins.
- `--radius-lg` is used for standard components.
- `--radius-full` creates pill-shaped buttons.

Rounded corners give the interface a soft, modern feel.

### Typography

Typography is controlled with variables for consistency.

- Font weights range from normal (400) to extra bold (800).
- Larger weights are used for strong headings.
- Heading sizes scale proportionally with body text.

### Overall Approach

The system focuses on:

- Clear hierarchy
- Consistent spacing
- Soft, modern visuals
- Centralized control through CSS variables
